 *  \defgroup Spambase Spambase Example
 *  \brief SPAM e-mail database (spambase): Machine learning using strongly-typed GP
 *     with Open BEAGLE.
 *
 *  \par Objective
 *  Find a program the will successfully predict whether a given e-mail is spam
 *  or not from some extracted features.
 *
 *  \par Comments
 *  The evolved programs works on floating-point values AND Booleans values.
 *  The programs must return a Boolean value which must be true if e-mail is
 *  spam, and false otherwise. Don't expect too much from this program as
 *  it is quite basic and not oriented toward performance. It is there mainly
 *  to illustrate the use of strongly-typed GP with Open BEAGLE.
 *
 *  \par Terminal set
 *  - IN0, IN1, ...  up to IN56, the e-mail features.      [floating-point]
 *  - 0 and 1, two Boolean constants.                      [Boolean]
 *  - Ephemeral constants randomly generated in $[0,100]$  [floating-point]
 *
 *  \par Function set
 *  - AND               [Inputs: Booleans,        Output: Boolean]
 *  - OR                [Input:  Boolean,         Output: Boolean]
 *  - NOT               [Inputs: Booleans,        Output: Boolean]
 *  - +                 [Inputs: floating-points, Output: floating-point]
 *  - -                 [Inputs: floating-points, Output: floating-point]
 *  - *                 [Inputs: floating-points, Output: floating-point]
 *  - /                 [Inputs: floating-points, Output: floating-point]
 *  - <                 [Inputs: floating-points, Output: Booleans]
 *  - ==                [Inputs: floating-points, Output: Booleans]
 *  - if-then-else      [1st Input: Boolean, 2nd & 3rd Input: floating-points,
 *                       Output: floating-point]
 *
 *  \par Fitness cases
 *  A random sample of 400 e-mails over the database, re-chosen for
 *  each fitness evaluation.
 *
 *  \par Hits
 *  Number of correct outputs obtained over the 400 fitness cases.
 *
 *  \par Raw fitness
 *  Ignored (always 0).
 *
 *  \par Standardized fitness
 *  Rate of correct outputs over the fitness cases where
 *  the desired output was 0 (non-spam).
 *
 *  \par Adjusted fitness
 *  Rate of correct outputs over the fitness cases where
 *  the desired output was 1 (spam).
 *
 *  \par Normalized fitness
 *  Rate of correct outputs obtained over all the 400 fitness cases.
 *
 *  \par Stopping criteria
 *  When the best individual scores 400 hits or when the evolution reaches
 *  the maximum number of generations.
